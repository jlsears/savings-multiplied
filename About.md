# About Jen Sears


> A little bit of creativity. a little bit of system configuration dexterity. And coming soon, a little of programming wizardry just to top it all off.


> So in short, what I will be able to bring to you includes:

1. A certain nimbleness with the written word and smashing liberal arts background.
1. Years of skill development in system configuration, data scrubbing, and generally bending data to my will.
1. Coding skill deviousness currently in the process of being finely honed.
